# GFX6502

The point of this pet project is to:

1. Learn 6502 assembly
2. Learn 3D graphics programming
3. Implement a 3D engine in 6502 assembly

Below are a sea of notes and ideas to do so. 

If you're looking for order, come back in a few months (:

## 6502 Basics

- Best tutorial ever, learn 6502 assembly in one sitting: Assembly In One Step. 
  - Link: https://dwheeler.com/6502/oneelkruns/asm1step.html
- Easy6502. Good explanations! 
  - Link: http://skilldrick.github.io/easy6502/
- Extensively commented opcode list.
  - Link: https://www.atariarchives.org/alp/appendix_1.php

## Exercises

Start with the Easy6502 emulator. Then move on to 8bitworkshop. Lastly, build a local dev environment.

- [ ] See the Snake game from Easy6502 above. Re-implement it from memory, fixing the bugs discussed in this gist: https://gist.github.com/wkjagt/9043907
  - Run it locally: https://github.com/skilldrick/6502js
  - Fun fact: I helped! ðŸŽ‰ https://github.com/skilldrick/6502js/pull/9
- [ ] Learn Bresenham's line drawing algorithm. 
  - [ ] Implement it from memory in Go.
  - [ ] Implement it for 6502, either NES or 6502js.
  - [ ] Implement it from memory on the NES.
  
- [ ] Re-implement all of these: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB_ibvUSN7mzUffhiay5g5GUHyJRO4DYr
